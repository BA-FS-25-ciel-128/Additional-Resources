# Additional Resources

This repository contains additional resources used in the process of writing our Bachelor's thesis and creating the prototype.
Some of the content in this repository is not included in the actual thesis paper - for example, videos or other media that couldn't be embedded in the document. Other materials are part of the thesis, but are included here again to provide a convenient and complete collection of all related resources.

# Content
## Annotation
This folder contains the annotated responses as well as an Excel file listing all extracted body and facial animations. Each animation is assigned a number, which corresponds to the numbers used in the annotation list. This makes it easy to see which annotation has been mapped to which animation.

**Please note:** The original text passages that were annotated are not included in this repository due to data protection regulations. Only the annotations themselves and the mapped animation references are provided.

## Animations
This folder contains a collection of videos showcasing each individual animation created during the project. It is organised into two subfolders: Facial Animations and Body Animations. The collection serves as a quick reference to review all available animations.

Additionally, there's a folder for OpenAI-related content, which includes an example of how animation choices were selected using OpenAI.

All of these videos were part of the final user survey (with the exception of the idle body animation, since it was not included in the set of annotated animations)

## Survey

This folder contains all results from the final user survey conducted during the project. It includes an Excel file with the full dataset.

Additionally, there is a separate file listing all free-text responses, including answers to open-ended questions as well as responses given under the "Other" option in multiple-choice items.
